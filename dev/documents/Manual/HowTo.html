        <p>This is the game screen, there are two main segments of the game screen.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>1. The Game Board</h3>
          <p>
            The game board is where the action happens, this is how you'll
            interact with the game and will see the main game playing out in
            front of you.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>2. The Sidebar</h3>
          <p>
            The sidebar, whilst not interactive, is very important as it stores
            valuable information neccessary whilst playing the game. For example;
            how much currency you have; the number of healthy blocks; etc.
          </p>
        </div>
        <hr>

        <div>
          <img src = "Resources/Pause.png">
          <p>
            You can pause the game at any time, just press the 'P' key. From the pause
            screen you can press 'P' again to return to the game, or use the buttons to
            navigate to the menu or exit the game.
          </p>
        </div>
        <hr>

        <div>
          <img src = "Resources/Spread.gif">
          <p>
            You need to stop the illness from spreading to all the healthy blocks
            on the board. The sickness spreads to the healthy blocks and the corruption
            spreads to the sickness blocks. Once a block becomes corrupt it cannot be
            saved and is permanently stuck.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <img src = "Resources/Blink.gif">
          <p>
            If a sick block is blinking like this then it is about to become corrupt,
            without even needing to be in contact with another corrupt block. These
            blocks need to be handled immediately as they are very volatile.
          </p>
        </div>
        <hr>

        <div>
          <img src = "Resources/Heal.gif">
          <p>
            You can heal sick blocks to turn them back to healthy ones. To do this the
            sick block must be in contact with one, or more, healthy blocks and then you
            just have to Left Click on the sick block to heal it. Healing a sick block
            gives you 15 points, these points can be used to create immune blocks.s
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <img src = "Resources/Immune.gif">
          <p>
            When you have enough points, you can make an immune block by Right Clicking on
            any healthy block on the board. Immune blocks cannot be turned sick or corrupt,
            they are used to block off the sickness permanently and protect the healthy
            blocks.
          </p>
        </div>
        <hr>

        <div>
          <img src = "Resources/Contain.png">
          <p>
            You must use both the healing of sickness and the placement of immune blocks to
            contain the sickness and stop the spreading, whilst having as many healthy blocks
            left on the game board as possible. The more healthy blocks the higher the end
            score.
