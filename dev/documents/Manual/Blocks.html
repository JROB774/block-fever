          <h3>Immune</h3>
          <p>
            The immune blocks have had an experimental medicine applied to make them
            immune to the effects of the illness spreading through the other blocks.
            Unfortunately this leaves the block in a frozen, vegetablised, state.
            As a result, these blocks can act as barriers to protect the population.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Healthy</h3>
          <p>
            The healthy blocks make up the majority of the population and are blocks
            that are yet to be effected by the illness but are vulnerable to its effects.
            At any moment one of these blocks could become infected, luckily, they can be
            cured as long as another healthy block is in contact with them.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Sick</h3>
          <p>
            The sick blocks have been infected with the illness, but they are able to become
            well once more if they are in contact with a healthy block and cured. However,
            these sick blocks are volatile and at any moment could become corrupt and at that
            point there's no hope for them.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Corrupt</h3>
          <p>
            The corrupt blocks are blocks so infected with the illness that there is no chance
            for them to be cured. If a healthy block comes in contact with one of these blocks
            the chance of them becoming sick is greatly increased. The only way to contain the
            illness it to close off all of these blocks.
